"Another Neovim configuration."
Because the world clearly needed one more.


---

🧩 Overview

Welcome to yet another Neovim setup. This configuration doesn't claim to be the best, the fastest, or the most innovative. But it exists, and sometimes, that's enough.


---

🗂️ Structure

init.lua: The heart of the configuration. Or at least, a vital organ.

lua/: Where the magic happens. Assuming you believe in magic.

lazy-lock.json: Because managing plugins shouldn't be too easy.



---

🔌 Plugins

A curated list of plugins, selected through a rigorous process of random selection and mild curiosity.

Lazy.nvim: For those who believe plugin management should be lazy.

nvim-cmp: Autocompletion, because typing is hard.

nvim-lspconfig: Language Server Protocol support. Fancy.

telescope.nvim: Fuzzy finding files you lost moments ago.

lualine.nvim: A status line to remind you of your status.

nvim-tree.lua: A file explorer, because :e is too mainstream.

which-key.nvim: Displays available keybindings. For when you forget what you bound.

nvim-treesitter: Better syntax highlighting. Allegedly.

vim-fugitive: Git integration. Blame others efficiently.

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/68mschmitt/nvim ~/.config/nvim


2. Open Neovim and let it do its thing. Hopefully.
